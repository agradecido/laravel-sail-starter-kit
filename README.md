### 1. Docker Installation Using Sail
Laravel Sail is a light-weight command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker development environment.

On Linux we can use these commands. To install Sail on other operating systems see [The Official Guide](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/#docker-installation-using-sail).
